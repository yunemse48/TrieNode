# TrieNode Project

## Overview
This project implements a trie data structure, often used for efficient information retrieval. The trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like structure that is particularly effective for managing dictionaries and implementing autocomplete systems.

## Features
- Efficient insertion and search operations.
- Support for prefix-based search, making it ideal for autocomplete suggestions.
- Scalable and optimised for high-performance scenarios.

## Usage
Modify the `Trie.js` file as requested, and run the script via `node ./Trie.js`. 

This project served as a learning tool for me, but it's open ended and flexible. It can be improved for further purposes.
